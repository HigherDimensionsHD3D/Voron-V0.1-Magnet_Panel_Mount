# Voron-V0.1-Magnet_Panel_Mount
converts the current voron v0.1 panel mounting parts into easily removeable magnetic mounts.
Perfect for switching between abs/pla without the hassle of unscrewing everytime.

Mounts using the basic m3x8 hardware that the original parts mounted with.

Included are the fles for a spacer to fill the gap between the frame and the panels to help with heat loss, this is not needed but will help. 
I have installed some 12mmx6mm adhesive draft excluder found easily on amazon.
